## Replit Deployment

To run this project on [Replit](https://replit.com):

1. **Create a new Repl** from this repository.
2. **Add environment variables** in the Replit *Secrets* panel:
   - `DATABASE_URL`
   - `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`
   - `OPENAI_API_KEY`
   - `GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID`
   - (optional) `SENDGRID_API_KEY`
3. **Install dependencies** and start the development server:
   ```bash
   npm install
   npm run dev
   ```
   The web client and API will be served on port `5000`.
4. **Apply database schema** when needed:
   ```bash
   npm run db:push
   ```

Replit automatically exposes the running server. Use the generated URL to test the application from a browser or mobile device.
