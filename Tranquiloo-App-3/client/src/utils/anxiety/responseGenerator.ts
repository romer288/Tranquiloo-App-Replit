**Try this 5-4-3-2-1 grounding technique right now:**
• Name 5 things you can see (look around the room)
• Name 4 things you can touch (feel their texture)
• Name 3 things you can hear (real sounds around you)
• Name 2 things you can smell
• Name 1 thing you can taste

**Also try:**
• Hold an ice cube or splash cold water on your face
• Count backwards from 100 by 7s
• Describe your real surroundings out loud
• Call someone you trust to talk

These experiences can be frightening, but grounding techniques can help. If this continues, please contact your doctor or mental health provider soon. You can also call 988 for immediate support.`;
